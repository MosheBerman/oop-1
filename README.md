The first homework assignment for CISC 3150, Object Oriented Programming, with Professor Zhou. This assignment has 3 parts, each must be done in two object oriented programming languages.

- **1.1** Implement a class, named Rational, for reduced-form rational numbers. The class has two member variables, named numerator and denominator, and provides member functions for the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A rational number is in the reduced form if the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator is 1.

- **1.2** Design and implement a class 'ParkingMeter' for parking meters. The class has three member variables: 'maxTime' for maximum parking minutes, 'rate' for parking rate (minutes per quarter), and 'time' for remaining parking time. The class should provide member functions for the client to insert quarters and check remaining parting time. The constructor should take the maximum parking minutes and the rate.

- **1.3** Implement a class 'Car' with the following properties. A car has a certain fuel efficiency (measured in miles/gallon) and a certain amount of fuel in the gas tank. The efficiency is specified in the constructor, and the initial fuel level is 0. Supply a method 'drive' that simulates driving the car for a certain distance, reducing the fuel level in the gas tank, and methods 'getGas', to return the current fuel level, and 'addGas' to tank up.
